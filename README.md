# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
This project is part of the Data Analysis with Python course on freeCodeCamp. It implements a mean-variance-standard deviation calculator using NumPy. The calculator takes a list of nine numbers and converts it into a 3x3 matrix, then computes the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum along both axes and the flattened matrix.

- mean_var_std.py: Contains the implementation of the calculator functions.

- main.py: The entry point to run the calculations and display results.

- test_module.py: Contains unit tests for the calculator functions.

# Functions
`mean(matrix, axis)`
Calculates the mean of the given matrix along the specified axis.

`var(matrix, axis)`
Calculates the variance of the given matrix along the specified axis.

`std(matrix, axis)`
Calculates the standard deviation of the given matrix along the specified axis.

`max(matrix, axis)`
Calculates the maximum value of the given matrix along the specified axis.

`min(matrix, axis)`
Calculates the minimum value of the given matrix along the specified axis.

`sum(matrix, axis)`
Calculates the sum of the given matrix along the specified axis.

`calculate(list)`
Takes a list of nine numbers, converts it into a 3x3 matrix, and returns a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum along both axes and the flattened matrix.
